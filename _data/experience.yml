    Consulting and support activities at some of the largest companies active in the financial, eyewear, telecommunications, media and communication sectors.  
    Some of the projects I have worked on consist in the construction of CRM solutions based on Hadoop, design of new big data architectures and realization of tools for anomaly detection.  
    I have carried out teaching activities to train customersâ€™ staff to use the developed tools. In addition I have also carried out tech-discovery activities with the aim of developing partnerships with software vendors.  
    Some of the tools used so far are Hadoop, Hive, Apache Drill, Spark, StreamSets, MapR, Neo4j, Tableau, several programming languages such as Python, Java and JavaScript and query languages such as SQL and Cypher. 
    The participation in several training courses, both at home and in other countries, for the learning of data ingestion tools, datawarehouse and new data analytics frameworks have allowed me to acquire considerable practical know-how in the construction of ETL processes, data warehousing and data analytics.
